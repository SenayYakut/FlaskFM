# FlaskFM

In this project, you will create a web service, called FlaskFM, that will allow users to add songs to their personalized list from a song library curated by an administrator through a dashboard page. You will model users and playlists that can be changed by users who add or remove songs. The project work will focus on the database aspect, but you will create a functional web service for your users with us providing you templates, routes, and guidance.
